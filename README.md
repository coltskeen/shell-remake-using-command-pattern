This project is my solution to the code crafters challenge to build your own shell. 
I chose C# to gain a better understanding of the classes and methods that can be used to interact with the file system.
I also chose to use the command design pattern to understand its pros and cons more.

**Commands implemented:** echo, type, cat, exit, pwd, cd, and running executable files..
